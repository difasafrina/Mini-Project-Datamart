# Mini-Project-Datamart

In this mini project, I was given a case to create a datamart that can display :

1. View rental income from movies based on
   - Movie Title.
   - Movie Rating
   - Movie Category

2. Conduct customer segmentation
   -  Borrowing Frequency
   -  Total Rental Cost
   -  Types of movies that are often rented (movie category and movie rating)

3. View late rental information such as
   - Movies that are returned late most often
   - How many cancelations in a certain period
